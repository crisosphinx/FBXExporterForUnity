# FBXExporterForUnity
The FBXExporter for Unity.

This tool does some amazing things for exporting files out of Unity as a Binary FBX as opposed to ASCII format FBX.


To install, follow the instructions below:
----------------

 - Download the project,
 - Export all files into the main Unity directory (all Asset files should go in the Asset directory in Unity),
 - Right-click a Prefab model,
 - An option should appear to Export your Prefab model out of Unity... Click on that,
 - Should be done and good to use with Blender or your preferred 3D modeling software.
